# AB-Test-Project

This project deals with the analysis of an AB test results of an online store. First, we will have to examine and prioritize different candidate hypotheses for testing. Second, we will analyze the results of a 1-month AB test in order to determine whether the test should be continued or stopped, and/or whether the changes to the website/product had a benefical effect on sales.
